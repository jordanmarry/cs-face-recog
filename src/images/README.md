# Directions
This is where you're training data goes for the facial recognition. Only add photos of the player's face.

Create a new folder of each player in this folder. Then add your images inside those specified folders. **ONLY PNG/JPG!**
## Example
For example, you create a folder called s1mple and you add 3 pngs of his face inside the s1mple folder.
This is what the file system tree would look like below.
```
cs-face-recog/
  ├── src/
    ├── images/
      ├── s1mple/
        ├── 1.png
        ├── 2.png
        ├── 3.png
```
